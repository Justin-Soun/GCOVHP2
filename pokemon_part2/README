You teach me and I'll teach you - Pokémon!

Part 2 is to implement Pokémon battling!

You should have finished part 1 before doing
this. Copy your main.cc over from your
previous folder: cp ../pokemon/main.cc .

To get an A you must do the following:

========================================
1) The user must select two Pokémon to battle, using either
index or name (or both)

Whichever Pokémon with the higher speed is the attacker, the slower one is the
defender. If there is a tie, the one entered first is the attacker.

2) Enter a move that the attacker will do to the defender

3) You output how much damage the move does to the defender (rounded to the
nearest whole number)

The formula for damage on a normal move is this:
(power * attack)/defense * STAB * type_modifier

The formula for damage on a special move is this:
(power * special_attack)/special_defense * STAB * type_modifier

Max damage (or if defense is 0) is 9999.

Explanation:
Power   - the power of the move (found in the move database)
Attack  - the attack stat of the attacking pokemon
Defense - the defense stat of the defending pokemon
STAB    - see below
type_modifier - see below

Examples: Mew (Attack 100) uses Psybeam (Power 65) on Rattata (Defense 35).
Mew is a psychic pokemon and Psybeam is a psychic move, so STAB applies -

double(65 * 100) / 35 * 1.5 * 1; //Normal Rattata (Normal)
double(65 * 100) / 35 * 1.5 * 0.5; //Alolan Rattata (Normal/Dark)

So Mew would do 278.57, rounded to 279 damage to a normal Rattata
Mew would do 139 damage to an Alolan Rattata (psychic does half damage to
dark)

========================================
4) STAB

If the type of the move matches the type of the pokemon, it will do +50% bonus
damage. It can match on either type (so a fire move by a fire/ice pokemon would get
the +50% bonus damage)

If STAB applies, the multiplier is 1.5x
If the types don't match, multiplier is 1x

========================================

5) Implement the type system from Pokémon.
 If a Pokémon has the same type as the move it is
 doing it should do 50% more damage. Some attacking types deal
 extra damage or less damage to defending types, as shown here:
 https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Type/Type_chart#Generation_I
 I have copied the values into a file called "type_system.txt" for
 you that you can use to look up the damage modifiers.

I will give you a function that tells you which type corresponds to which
row/column of the table (look at mapdemo.cc).
