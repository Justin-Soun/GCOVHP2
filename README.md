<p>In this project, we worked on the ZETA function homework that Justin provided. In this HW we had to write a function that finds whether a number is prime and then calculates how many prime numbers are smaller than the one given. So if we give a range of prime numbers like 2 and 6 it calculates how many prime numbers exist between them so 5 and 3. The function gets how many prime numbers exist adds gives the total number of prime numbers. So when given big numbers it takes time to find all the prime numbers which takes more than 1 second.
