<p>In this project, we worked on the ZETA function homework that Justin provided. In this HW we had to write a function that finds whether a number is prime and then calculates how many prime numbers are smaller than the one given. So if we give a range of prime numbers like 2 and 6 it calculates how many prime numbers exist between them so 5 and 3. The function gets how many prime numbers exist adds gives the total number of prime numbers. So when given big numbers it takes time to find all the prime numbers which takes more than 1 second.

Optimizer Prime: Justin had the vital role of providing us with the HW code and then solving it. After solving it his main job was attempting to optimize the code.
EdgeLord: Ansh had the task of providing multiple tests within the code to ensure that the code was running correctly and smoothly. 
Glord: Oscar had the job of implementing Gcov so that we could test and benchmark the code.
GitWizard: Omar had the job of writing the documentation for the project and helping with its organization.
